# Virtual Pet Simulator

Welcome to my Virtual Pet Simulator! (Pet Care Sim).
This console application allows you to simulate caring for a virtual pet by performing various actions such as feeding, playing, and resting.

## Project Description

This project is a simple console application written in C# that demonstrates basic programming concepts, including user input, control flow, and data manipulation. The virtual pet has attributes such as hunger, happiness, and health, and the user can interact with the pet to affect these attributes.
